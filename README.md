# Data Scientist

## About
As a data enthusiast graduate with a chemical engineering background, I have developed a strong foundation in data analytics, machine learning, and computational fluid dynamics. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems and provide innovative solutions.

I have gained valuable practical experience as a data scientist intern at id/x partners, where I helped lending companies analyze their customers' credit risks using Python and machine learning models. I also collaborated on a research project at UGM, where I used ANSYS Fluent to simulate and examine the flow characteristics of industrial inline mixers, resulting in a journal publication. These experiences have enhanced my research, communication, and teamwork skills, as well as my passion for data science.

I am looking for opportunities to further expand my skillset and learn from experts in the field. I am motivated by challenges and driven by curiosity. I am always open to feedback and eager to improve. I believe that data science has the potential to create positive impacts in various domains, and I aspire to be part of that journey.

#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, ANSYS Fluent

### Education
Bachelor of Chemical Engineering | Universitas Gadjah Mada (_July 2023_)

### Experience
* Project-Based Virtual Intern : Data Scientist @ ID/X Partners x Rakamin Academy\
Helps lending companies make more informed and accurate decisions by analyzing their customers' credit risks. With existing data including credit history, demographics, income, and payment experience, the data is processed. Data processing includes handling missing values, data standardization, and exploratory data analysis. After the data is analyzed and refined, a machine learning model is trained with the training data to produce a usable model.

In this project, clients are grouped into two groups, namely high-risk and low-risk. Various attributes are visualized to see the relationships between them. Finally, the Random Forest algorithm is applied to the attributes to produce a model that can distinguish high- or low-risk borrowers.

Convolutional Neural Networks techniques are used to classify datasets in the form of photographs of rock, scissors, and paper hand symbols. After training the model with augmented images, the model's accuracy was up to 98%.
